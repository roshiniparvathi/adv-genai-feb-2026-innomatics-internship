# Logic Building Task – 1

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains Python solutions for basic logic-building problems. These tasks help in understanding conditional statements, loops, and data handling in Python.

--------

## 🛠 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Any code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter, etc.)

--------

## 📂 Tasks Included

### 1. User Login Check

Checks whether the entered username and password are correct.

**Concepts Used:**

* Variables
* Conditional statements (`if-else`)

**Real-World Use:** Authentication systems

--------

### 2. Pass / Fail Analyzer

Analyzes student marks and counts how many students passed or failed.

**Concepts Used:**

* Lists
* Loops
* Conditions

**Real-World Use:** Academic evaluation systems

--------

### 3. Simple Data Cleaner

Cleans and standardizes user names by removing spaces and converting to lowercase.

**Concepts Used:**

* String methods (`strip()`, `lower()`)
* Loops

**Real-World Use:** Data preprocessing

--------

### 4. Message Length Analyzer

Calculates message length and flags long messages.

**Concepts Used:**

* `len()` function
* Conditional statements

**Real-World Use:** Text validation systems

--------

### 5. Error Message Detector

Counts the number of error messages in system logs.

**Concepts Used:**

* Lists
* Looping
* Counters

**Real-World Use:** Log monitoring systems

--------
